  Competent with almost every Linux distro but mainly:
    * Arch Linux (my current distro #1)
    * Nix/NixPkgs/NixOS (my current distro #2)

    * Centos/Fedora based (RHEL and CloudLinux included)
    * (a bit rusty) Gentoo (my first real "love" distro)


  My actual distro is nixOS.
  I’m also using Nix/NixPkgs everywhere with Ubuntu and Arch wherever it is possible and makes sense considering the use case.
  I'm also quite confident with Microsoft products (I already met ActiveDirectory more than once) and Apple products as I always worked in cross-platform environments (Linux on the servers and proprietary software on desktops).
  I also played with most other *nix based systems (BSD, SmartOS) and a lot of different weird linux distro (Arch, Gentoo, sorceror/archmage, pentoo, ecc)
